1. Why did we choose m_health to be a signed integer? (Hint: what happens if the
Hero has a health of 1, and someone does 2 points of damage to them.)
- Signed Integer means m_health can be either positive or negative, which we use to identify which heroes
died first, by choosing which heroes have the negative m_health

2. Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the class SuperHero?
(Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere in it?)
How about the reverse, does SuperHero know about the Hero class?
- No, because Hero class has no relation to the SuperHero class, but the SuperHero class does need to know
about the existance of Hero class

3. The program prints out “AncientBattle!” when 2 Heros fight. It prints out
“SuperFight!” when 2 SuperHeros fight. When you try to make a Hero fight a
SuperHero, what did it print out?
- It will print "AncientBattle" because SuperHero and Hero attack, they will just attack as normal Hero
