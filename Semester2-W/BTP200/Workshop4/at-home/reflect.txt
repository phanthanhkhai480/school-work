1) What is meant by a safe empty state? What other safe empty state you would choose for the type Passenger? Explain why.
- Safe Empty State use when the passing value isn't satisfy with the condition, then we delete the passing value and set all the member to 0,
empty string or null pointer to avoid garbage value. I used the safe empty state for the checking valid Passenger, for accompanied friends. 

2) Describe a case where having multiple constructors for the type Passenger
would simplify the code of clients that use it. 
- It is the case like we did in this workshop, where we have 2 constructors for Passenger that break down the work and make the code easier to
edit and it is easier to pass the value since non of the passing value are the same
