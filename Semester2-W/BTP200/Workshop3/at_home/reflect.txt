1- In a file called reflect.txt and using examples from your own code explain which
features of object orientation you used.
- I used class to contain all of the function that I wrote to make my program work. So inside the class, I create different member of variable and used for function to access and
store information. For exmaple, in the code, I create function name() so it can pass the name to the variable I declared in the class, initialize same process for card number, card
institution number, expiry date and number in the back, then the card valid I used all of the information that I already save them in the class to check whether if they all fall into
the correct position and the write is to access all the variable in the class to save data into it

2- Explain your understanding of the do-while loop written in the main program,
especially the condition that makes it stop. Also explain the choice of type for
storing the credit card number
- The do-while loop written in the main program represent for the condition in which in the information the user entered is correct or not. If the information
is correct within the condition, then it will skip the loop and go to the next one, otherwise, it will just keep repeat until all of the information is correct
- The type used for Credit Card Number is long long (16 byte), which is to store a very large number like credit card number
