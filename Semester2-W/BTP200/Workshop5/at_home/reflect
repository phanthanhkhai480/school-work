1. Discuss why operator+= should return a reference to Fraction.
- Because when we doing the calculation for the operator, we will return all value to the left-hand variable, therefore the value isn't constant and we need reference to access as it can
change anytime
 
2. In w5_in_lab.cpp (tester module), we calculated B+3 successfully. Explain how it is
possible while we did not define the operator+ function for Fraction and integer.
- Because we define in constructor of Fraction that denominator will be interger over 1, therefore the operator+ function will automatically understand that the integer is a fraction

3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
- I've learned how the friend function work as well as I've learnt something new called explicit where I can pass the value and it will return the calculation right away without
implement it.
- I've learned how operator work as there are many type of operator and each of them will need to declare differently.
