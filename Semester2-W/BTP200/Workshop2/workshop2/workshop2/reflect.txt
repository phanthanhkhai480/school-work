1) What happens to dynamic memory if it is not deallocated?
- Deallocated means to remove a value of a number in a array, to dellocated them from the array

2) What is the difference between dynamic and static memory? Give examples
from you code where have you used dynamic memory and where have you
used static memory.
- Static memory means global variables, use when the program begins. It is declared to use in the entire program without restriction
- Dynamic memory means 	local variable, use only inside a function or a specific location and can't be access outside, or with restriction and to redeclare in order to use

3) Explain what have you learned in this workshop
- I've learned about how to allocated value in the array, how to access function inside a namespace as well as how to do overloading function
