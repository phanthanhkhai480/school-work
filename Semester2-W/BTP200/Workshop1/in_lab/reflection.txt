1. What is a namespace? Explain its purpose.
- A namespace is group that can contain all the prototypes or implementation which make it easier when you need to call them somewhere else
- Purpose of namespace is to avoid same variable name as it usually happen. So you can have many variable X, Y and Z but each has to be in different namespace 

2. Why header files are needed? Explain. 
- Header Files are needed  because it improve build time as there can be many people work together in a signle file, which they splitted up the work and write in header file, then include
in the main. It is also easier to find mistake because they all divided into small file with just little coding.
