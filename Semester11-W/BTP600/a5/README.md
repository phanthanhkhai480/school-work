# Part 2: Reflection
### 1. Describe the key changes you made to redesign the code to follow the pattern

### 2. Which was easier for you to read, the original code or the state version of the code? Why? (there is no wrong answer for which is easier.. but you do have to explain why you say this)
- In my opinion, the Original Code is easier to read at first, where at each of the function has every layout, you look at the function and scan for the state, and it tell you what the program will do at that certain state.
- But after some work and organize, the code will look much easier to understand, like each class will represent a state and by going into each of the class, you can understand at that state, what are the necessary operations for that, instead of scrolling up and down to find the answer as each of the function will be long.

### 3. Suppose you had to add a Peer Review State to your code. The following diagram describes the state transition:
