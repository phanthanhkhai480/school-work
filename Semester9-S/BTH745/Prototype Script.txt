Hi everyone, Welcome to our group prototype

There are a few things we want to address you guys before the test can begin
	1. The test is based on our approach for this, therefore, only the main 
functionality we focused on will work. Not ALL functionality and buttons 
exist on the screen will work.
	2. The best option to know which interaction we offer is to click outside 
the UI area. A quick flash will pop-up to display where did our group put 
the interaction in.
	3. Some of the interaction we have prepare are:
	- Login and Create an Account in the Login page
	- Create Account in the Sign-up page
	- Switching between Group and Individual Chat, Filter, Searching option,
		Chat File Access should work on all of the prototypes.
 
Here's our approach for this prototypes:
	- Automatic Coding Language Detection 	(no interaction require)
	- Code Colour format like VS 		(no interaction require)
	- Use GitHub to share files 		(interaction require)
	- Code Debugging in App  		(interaction require)
	     (ensure that code is actually running)
	- File Access 				(interaction require)

HERE IS THE TASK THAT EACH TESTER NEED TO FOLLOW:
-From the main screen, navigate to individual chat section and open GitHub.
-From the current screen, navigate to searching and open File Access.
-From the current screen, navigate to Android Filter and Debug a program from the chat.
	Ensure the program is running.


If it is possible, please have a time recorder to measure how long does it take
to find each of the approaches. The entire experiment should take less than 5m. 

Note to Observer
ERROR is count when tester click on OTHER running function besides the one they are suppose to
For example: if tester is test to find File Access, they cannot mistaken click on Filter option
