For Test Cases, we want to perform as many test cases related to our approach as possible. However, about half 
of our approach features was implemented to display without any interaction required, those are Coding Language 
detected and Coding colour formatted, which I will show you later on

Therefore, it left us with 2 features with required interaction are GitHub interaction testing and in-app 
Code Debugging. I also add an optional test case as it is partially relevant to our approach, which is the File Access.

This is an image of what user should expect when they testing for GitHub interaction.
And this one is for Code Debugging.
This one is also Code Debugging, but running with a result.
The last one is how the File Access should be display. So in the picture, you can easily see the Coding Language
detection features and the coding colour formatted.
