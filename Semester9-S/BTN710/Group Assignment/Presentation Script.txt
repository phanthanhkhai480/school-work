Hi everyone, today our group would like to present a network exploit
that we have been working throughout the term. Our group member are
Khai, Marco, Andriy and Carlianz. 

For the first part, I will quickly talk about the method we will use
for the exploit, the website, the applications and the operating system.

For the exploit, our group has decided to work on DDoS attack, specifically
on direct attack to the host target. We could perform an SQL injection,
but it seems that most of us has already try that method out so we are
interesting to know one more way of doing the exploit.

Software we will be using is HULK (stand for HTTP Unbearable Load King). 
Since this is just a free software to monitor how the test work, they 
are not as strong as the botnet (which will cause us money if we decide
to hire one), but botnet is illegal and too much powerful for us to use,
HULK will be safe option to proceed. Details about HULK will be demonstrate
later by Marco.

Since we will be using the free version, it will not be powerful enough
to take down an actual host website (like heroku, they are built to stand
with millions of requests).
