3 types of Firewall: Packet Filtering, Packet Application and Packet Inspection
Packet Filtering check one packet at a time (by checking the header and spoofed ID address),
	it has multiple distinct stages and each stages use different filtering rules.
Use Access Control List (ACL) to allow each connection. Apply from first to last rules
Application Firewall is a firewall that controls input, output and access from an application/service
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) look for suspicious traffic, will alert user for potential serious attack
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) use filtered IDS, identify the spectrum of each attack and allows firm
	to determine the risk. 
Unified Threat Management (UTM) is application that use the support firewall to eliminate Internet threat
DMZ required all incoming traffic to pass through it before heading to the firewall, it is known as a
	subnet for servers and application proxy firewalls. It must be strong to handle all of the
	incoming connection because that will be the first point attacker will attack


Host is any device that contain an IP address
Backup data, Restrict Physical Access to hosts, Install OS with secure options, install patches to avoid
	vulnerabilities, manage access and permission, ecrypted data, add additional firewall, read log
Use different baseline for different OS and different server functions
Use VM to increase fault tolerance, reduce the chance of getting attack and perform any necessary test
	before rolling out
Do vulnerability testing for detect any loop holes or vulnerability


Many application run with super user (root) permission
Avoid any default security and always apply patches when available to enhance security
Add additional authentication, authorization and auditing layer
Buffer Overflow Attacks: specified action are needed in some coding languages, some doesn't require.
	When user sending too much data, the buffer might overflow and overwriting an adjacent to RAM
Login Bypass: enter URL or SQL for login details
Cross-site Scripting (XSS): One user send an anonymous data type or script to server. The server store
	the information and when somebody request an access to that data, the server will send the scripting
	packet to the user company and damage the computer
SQL Injection: use a SQL query to execute command in database. If the attacker known the structure of SQL,
	they can easily perform an attack using just SQL query to extract and read the data
user who understand directory structure can use URL as a way to access into root data of a server and
	access many more detail of the root, including file contain
Use error log to understand what type of attack is happening for future prevention
Dancing Pig argument are malicious link that persuade the victim to click to. It's usually similar to
	what user is looking for on that page (ex. Download button)
Other Client-Side attacks: 
- File reading: turn victim computer to unintended file server, executing command on CMD
- Redirection: automatic redirect to unwanted page
- Cookies: use to track users at website and their behaviour


Shadowing: backup copy of each file every few minutes
Increment Backup: only detect changes and backup the changes
Restoration Order: do the full backup and incremental later, otherwise newer files will be overwritten
Continous Data Protion (CDP): has 2 server continously backup each others
Raid 0: use 2 disk speed, raid 1 write copy on each disk
Raid 5 is parity, use XOR'ing to calculate the data value of other disks.
	Take Box 1 in Disk 1 and Box 2 in Disk 2, use XOR'ing to have Parity of Box 1&2 in Disk 3.
	Use that to calculate data lost for future recovery
Restrict access to DBs via DBMS, rename admin accs, disable guest/public accs, use lowest permission
Key Escrow: store a copy of the key in a safe place, central key on corp, server
Data Loss Prevention (DLP): use policies, procedures and systems designed to avoid data leaking
Personally Identifiable Information (PII): information that can use to uniquely identify a person, include
	name, personal identification number, address, photo,...
Knowing a few information can have a high chance to identify the actual person
