Lecture 2
Shell Arithmetic

    expr is used to evaluate integer expressions in the Bourne shell (also works in Bash and Korn)
        spacing is inflexible, and special characters must be quoted
        eg. expr \( 2 + 3 \) \* 5
        eg. x=`expr $x + 1`
    let performs arithmetic in Bash and Korn shells
        $ is optional in front of variables:
        let x=(2+3)*5
        spacing is flexible if expression is within quotes:
        let "x = x + 1"
