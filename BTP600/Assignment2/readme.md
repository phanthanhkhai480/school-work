# Part 2: Reflection
1. The most challenging part of this Assignment was adapting the Decorator pattern to be used in JavaScript as the class structure of JavaScript differs quite a bit from Java or C++.
1. The easiest part of this challenge was getting the borders to draw apart from each other rather than on top of each other.
1. Using JavaScript there was no Component or Decorator class, only the concrete Component and Decorators. As JavaScript doesn't use the same class structure as other languages and is loosly typed,
using only concrete classes works for this structure.
