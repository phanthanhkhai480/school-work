folder name: TeachingDemo

A. Deployment of the RMI Server.

0. Open a DOS command prompt window.

   Go to the subfolder "ServerDir."

   We have three source files in the folder(ServerDir): 

      Product.java, ProductImpl.java, ProductServer.java
	  
[Note: Skip Step 1 if you're using Java 8.]
1. >javac ProudctImpl.java

[Note: Skip Step 2 if you're using Java 8.]
2. >rmic  -v1.2 ProductImpl

[Note: Skip Step 3 if the server code uses the createRegistry() method.]
3. >rmiregistry 6666

[Note: If you have skipped Step 3, you may use the same DOS command prompt window.]
4. Open another DOS command prompt window.

   Go to the subfolder "ServerDir."

   >javac ProductServer.java

   >java ProductServer

(Question: How many class files do you have in the end?)

B. Deployment of the RMI Client.

0. Open a DOS command prompt window.

   Go to the folder "ClientDir."

   We have two source files in the folder(ClientDir): 

      Product.java, ProductClient.java.

[Note: Skip Step 1 if you are using Java 8.]
1. copy "ProductImpl_Stub.class" from "ServerDir" into this folder(ClientDir).

2. >javac ProductClient.java

3. >java ProductClient

(Question: How many class files do you have in the end?)
