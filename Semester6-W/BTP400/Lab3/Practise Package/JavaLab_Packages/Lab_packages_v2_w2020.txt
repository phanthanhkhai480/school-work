Focus: Working with Java Packages of Classes. (updated on 1/30/2020)

Note: You are not required to submit your answers to the questions.

PART 0: READING.
1. Read "Creating and Using Packages" in The Java Tutorials:
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/packages.htm.

PART 1A: Set up the directory structure for a Java package.
0. You should have four Java source files after you have unzipped JavaLab_Pacakages.zip.

1. a) Open a command prompt window.
- Opened
   b) Create a working directory.
      c:\>mkdir c:\temp 
- Created
	  
   c) Copy three Java sources (PackageDemo.java, May.java, August.java)
      into this working directory.
- Moved

2. a) Inspect these two source files: May.java and August.java. 
      Question 1: What is the package name?
- Package name was seneca.summer2004

   b) Inspect the source file: PackageDemo.java. 
      Question 2: What is the package name?
- There is no package name

3. a) In the current working directory, create a subdirectory/subfolder with the name "seneca."
      c:\temp>mkdir seneca
- Created

   b) Under the "seneca" subdirectory, create another subdirectory with the name "summer2004."
      c:\temp>cd seneca
	  c:\temp\seneca>mkdir summer2004
- Created
   
   c) MOVE (not copy) May.java and August.java from the current working directory (c:\temp) into \summer2004.
- Moved

4. a) Read the comments in PackageDemo.java.
      Question 3: How do you compile PackageDemo.java?
- I used the command javac PackageDemo.java and it automatically execute and generate the .class files

   b) Compile PackageDemo.java.
- It ran

   c) Inspect the subdirectory "summer2004". 
      Question 4: Do you find class files there? What are their names?
- The system generated the .class files for August.java and May.java file

5. Read the comments in PackageDemo.java.
   Question 1A.5: How do you run the class file (PackageDemo.class)?
- I ran using the command java PackageDemo
  
6. Take a screenshot of your command prompt window.
- Done

7. Note: During your demo time, without looking at this document, you are expected to show all these steps 
         about creating, compiling and running Java packages within a command prompt window. 
 
      
PART 1B: Set up the directory structure for a Java package, ANYWHERE on the file system. 
1. Create a directory with a name such as "c:\elsewhere".
- Created

2. Use this directory (i.e. c:\elsewhere) to create the Java packages on the file system.
- Created

3. Go back to your previous working directory (e.g. c:\temp) used in Part 1A.
   Delete the subdirectory "seneca". PackageDemo.java should still be in the working directory (c:\temp).
- Done

4. a) Read the comments in PackageDemo.java.
      Question 1: How do you compile and run PackageDemo.java?	  
- Since May and August are in new location, I have to specify the new location where the files 
are so the PackageDemo can located it and compile it
   b) Compile and run PackageDemo.java.
- javac -classpath .;C:\Users\phant\Desktop\Lab3 PackageDemo.java
- java -classpath .;C:\Users\phant\Desktop\Lab3 PackageDemo
   
5. Take a screenshot of your command prompt window.  
- Done
   
6. Note: During your demo time, Next week, you may be asked about using classpaths in compiling and running a Java package.

PART 1C: SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
Submit two screenshots of the command prompt windows at Blackboard.

PART 2A: DO IT AT HOME. NO SUBMISSION REQUIRED.
Note: You are not required to submit the work that you do at home. However, you may be asked to 
      answer questions related to the work done at home.

1. READING
   Read the following sections in The Java Tutorials.
   a) Managing Source and Class Files
      https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/managingfiles.html.
- Done

   b) How to use "javac -directory"?
      https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html.
- Done


PART 2B: DO IT AT HOME. NO SUBMISSION REQUIRED.
1. Assign the package name "seneca.summer2004" to the Java class in PackageDemo.java.
   a) Comment out the statement "import seneca.summer2004.*;" in PackageDemo.java.
- Done

   b) Insert the statement "package seneca.summer2004;" at the beginning of PackageDemo.java.
- Done
   
2. Select your root directory for the package "seneca.summer2004" (e.g. c:\elsewhere or c:\temp).
- Done

3. Question: Where are you going to put PackageDemo.java?


4. Try the following 2 commands:

    >javac   ./seneca/summer2004/PackageDemo.java

    >java    seneca.summer2004.PackageDemo
        
5. Question: Are you able to run the Java application successfully?
- I was able to run the first commamd to generate the .class file only
- However on the 2nd one, I cannot run the PackageDemo
      	
      	
Part 3A: DO IT AT HOME. NO SUBMISSION REQUIRED.
Objective: Create three packages of these four Java classes (within a command prompt window):
      - lab.testing.PackageDemo, 
      - opensource.seneca.January, 
      - seneca.summer2004.May, seneca.summer2004.August.
	     
1. Modify the source code of lab.testing.PackageDemo such that its toString() method will invoke the toString() methods
   from opensource.seneca.January, seneca.summer2004.May and seneca.summer2004.August. 
   (Note: You will find January.java in the zip file.)
   
2. a) Select your current working directory such as c:\temp.
   b) Put all three packages in the working directory.
   c) Question: How do you compile and run lab3.testing.PackageDemo from your current working directory?
      (Note: The lab3.testing.PackageDemo class has the main method.)

Part 3B: DO IT AT HOME. NO SUBMISSION REQUIRED.
1. Use another working directory (e.g. c:\temp\testjava) such that it is not the root directory for these packages.

2. Question: How do you compile and run lab.testing.PackageDemo at this working directory (i.e. c:\temp\testjava\)?
