Khai Phan: 4.5/5
- During this assignment, I've successfully find a teammates that I can actually work on
this project. I divided the work and task for myself and my teammates and we both finish 
everything on time and with expected result. The missing 0.5 is that I never give myself
or anyone else a perfect score because there is always room to improve. 

Carlianz Pura: 4.5/5
- He is great teammates. When we divided and assigned each other's work, he's always
finish it on time and got everything done accurately. At first, he might not talk or
chat with you as much and you might think he is not doing anything but the more you work,
the better I see him.
