        <p>Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species,[1] ranging across all
          continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group is paraphyletic as it excludes
          the snakes and Amphisbaenia which are also squamates. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few
          centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon.</p>
        <p>Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Others are legless, and have long
          snake-like bodies. Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide. They are often
          territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with brightly colours, to attract mates
          and to intimidate rivals. Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller
          species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.</p>
