        <p>Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such
          as the booted eagle (Aquila pennata), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or
          red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster
          flight â€“ despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers.</p>
        <p> Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is
          the South Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (0.99 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species
          are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large, hooked beaks for ripping flesh from
          their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other
          birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful, having up to 3.6 times human acuity for the martial
          eagle, which enables them to spot potential prey from a very long distance.[2] This keen eyesight is
          primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the
          incoming light. The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.</p>
