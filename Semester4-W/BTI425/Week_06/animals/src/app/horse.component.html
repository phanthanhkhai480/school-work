        <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed
          ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. </p>
        <p>The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into
          the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their
          domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are
          domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral
          populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been
          domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true
          wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering
          everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.</p>
