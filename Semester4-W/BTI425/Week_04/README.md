Remember to run this command while in the directory/folder that has the `package.json` file:

```
npm i
```

### react-app-layout

Typical viewport that includes a number of sequentially-presented components.  
Also includes a navigation menu example that we can build upon in the "routing" topic.  

<br>

### react-tania-updated

Updated "Tania" example from last week.  
This one has a more clearly-defined and obvious component and containment structure.  

<br>

### react-tania-containment

A visualization (PNG image) that shows the containment structure of the elements rendered by the "react-tania-updated" code example. 

<br>

### react-router-intro

This code example is based on the content and code in the `react-app-layout` code example above.  
The React Router package was added. Then:
* `index.js` was updated to wrap the `App` component in `BrowserRouter` 
* `App` was updated to render a `Switch - Route` container 
* The nav menu `a` elements were changed to `Link` elements 

<br>

### react-ws-intro

This code example uses the Fetch API to communicate with the `reqres.in` testing service.  
It shows a typical approach to handling all common interaction tasks when working with an entity collection.
