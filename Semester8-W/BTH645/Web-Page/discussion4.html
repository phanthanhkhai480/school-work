			<h3><b style="font-size: 30px;">Discussion on Web Usability using AUDIO</b></h3> 
			<p>1. Use acceptable quality audio, not to bad since users can’t listen to it well or too 
                high quality where users won’t notice the differences and just waste the data.  </p>
            <p>2. Only enable sound where applicable and users are expecting it.    </p>
            <p>3. Notice the file type of audio, some file types are picky in an audio player.  </p>
            <p>4. Use an adequate length of audio, not too short that the user can’t feel it or not too long where users will get bored.    </p>
            <p>5. If audio requires manual play, place it where user can easily see and the button has 
                to be big enough so that user won’t misclick that with other content (if any).  </p>
