			<h3><b style="font-size: 30px;">Discussion on Web Usability using TEXT</b></h3>
			<p>1. Use only 2 to 3 fonts type through out the content and webpage.</p>
            <p>2. Font Size must be consistent between pages and content information.</p>
            <p>3. Use San Serif font for Heading or Title and Serif font for content information only.</p>
            <p>4. Avoid using a paragraph that is too long, especially those are not even talking to the main topic.</p>
            <p>5. Be concise about using font style such as <b>Bold</b>, <i>Italic</i>, <u>Underline</u>, ...</p>
            <p>6. Use as much as 2 colours in text only. More colours usage will confuse user.</p>
            <p>7. Section such as Email, Contact Us, Phone/Call,... should be clear and catch user attention.</p>
            <p>8. Highlight important information where necessary and required. It is very important that user cannot miss any important information.</p>
            <p>9. Enhance any piece of media use on the website, and make sure it is at least visible for normal user. Never attached a blurry image or an unplayable video.</p>
            <p>10. First impression is very important. User will leave the website right away if the UI is doesnâ€™t look nice, no matter how important the information on that website is.</p>
