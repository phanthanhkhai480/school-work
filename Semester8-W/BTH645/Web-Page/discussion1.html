			<h3><b style="font-size: 30px;">Discussion on Web Usability</b></h3> 
			<p>1. Ease of accessible in all platform and all devices where Internet is available.</p>
            <p>2. No extras installation or add-ons require.</p>
            <p>3. Established a website category and follow it consistently. Never go out of topic.</p>
            <p>4. Create an effective website where user can never get confused and foresee any unexpected interaction caused by the user.</p>
            <p>5. Search engine is a must, where it allowed user to make a quick search on information where they don’t have to come back and forth.</p>
            <p>6. Ensure system is always responsiveness. Ensure that back-up plan is available if a server side is down and no broken link exist.</p>
            <p>7. Engage user in various way like email, contact us,... let the user feel that they are not alone.</p>
            <p>8. Highlight important information where necessary and required. It is very important that user cannot miss any important information.</p>
            <p>9. Enhance any piece of media use on the website, and make sure it is at least visible for normal user. Never attached a blurry image or an unplayable video.</p>
            <p>10. First impression is very important. User will leave the website right away if the UI is doesn’t look nice, no matter how important the information on that website is.</p>
