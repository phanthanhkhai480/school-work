                <h3>Discussion Question</h3>
				<h4> 1) The reason of choosing the file format when creating your audio</h4>
				<p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">The first file: .mp3 format because it is the most common file, it is lossy, 
					compressed and reduced quality but it can be played easily anywhere. However, mp3 has different quality, known as kbps, can be 
					range from 64kbps up to 320kbps. </p>

				<p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">The second file: .wav format because it is uncompressed file, it can be run on any 
					Windows machine as it supported-by-default file for Windows audio. Moreover, this is the file type used to store media file in CD 
					(Music Album) and require conversion to/from the CD. Since it is uncompressed, it is meant to be use for editing and creating music production.	</p>

				<p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">The third file: .flac file format because the file type is used for lossless music data but 
					also at the same time compressed any unnecessary data to reduce file size a bit. .flac lossless file type can be convert into any other lossless
					file type without losing any audio data. However, since this file type is not very popular due to its size, it's not very commonly used
					and support widely. </p>

				<h4> 2) The use of audio on your website regarding usability</h4>
				<p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">I displayed all of the audio file on the top with description on each of them, plus an extra
					description on the file when the browser does not support the file type (it tells right away which file format isn't support). </p>

				<h4> 3) Any thoughts on different audio file formats, e.g., cons, pros, when to use.</h4>
				<p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">Each of the file format has its own pros and cons, some format help to reduce the size 
					without reducing the quality, which is good for music listening, however, there are some file format that hasn't reduce the size nor the 
					quality as well, and it is tend to use for editing, or there are some formats that reduce both the size and quality as well, as it is tend 
					to use on web browser for the audio to load quickly. 	</p>
				
				<h4> 4) Description of your editing on the file, e.g., cutting, assembly, fadein, fadeout, etc.,	</h4>
				<p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">First I downloaded the mp4 file from Youtube and then convert that into mp3 file. 
					Then I select a part and trim only that part (from 00:00:30 to 00:01.00). Then I add some extra features to that to see if the quality 
					would enhance in the way that I want or not. 	</p>
				<p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;"><b>Edit:</b> I have added the fadein to the original video from 00:00:00 to 00:00:05 and 
					fadeout from 00:00:25 to 00:00:30,with some Noise Reduction between 00:00:05 and 00:00:25	</p>
