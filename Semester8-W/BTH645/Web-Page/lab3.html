                <h3>Discussion Question</h3>
                <h4> 1) What's your modification? Any thoughts (why)? Steps?</h4>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;"><u>For the 1st editing image:</u> I added some Exposure (Brightness (+20), Contrast (+50), 
                    Highlight (+20) and Shadow (-30) to improve the lighting quality of the image.  Since I edited the image online (befunky.com), the steps 
                    are quite easy, all you need to do is select the free options available and  adjust the bar to see the differences in the image.                                                                 </p>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;"><u>For the 2nd editing image:</u> I used Adobe Photoshop to transform the original image 
                    into sketched/drawing image. I Applied the sRGB Curved to change the colours into black and white, then applied Hue and Saturation to vivid 
                    the lining details of the image, then use Color Dodge and Blur to enhance it.                                                                                                                             </p>

                <h4> 2) What are the differences you notice when you created/drew the new image(s)?</h4>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;"><u>For the 1st editing image:</u> The quality after I touched the image is improving alot, 
                    especially with the lighting in th background. With that being said, all the changes and improvement has been applied and therefore, 
                    increase the picture size for a bit.                          </p>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;"><u>For the 2nd editing image:</u> The quality after Io transform from colours image into 
                    sketched/drawing image has been reduced. Since there is no colours, the image size has been reduced for about 25%, and also, when zoom in 
                    to the image this image tends to have lower quality compared to the first 2.</p>

                <h4> 3) Is there any special consideration when you created/drew the new image(s)? What were the steps?</h4>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">All I want to do when I create the new image is to make the look as much better or similar 
                    to the original one, therefore, I have to use some image editing app to help me with that. There is no specific steps for each of those, 
                    most of the time, I'm just exploring around to see which combination match the most.                                                 </p>

                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <h4> 1) How hard do you rate this lab in a range 1-10, where 1 is easiest, 10 is the hardest?</h4>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">This lab is pretty good exercises for me as a photographer to edit the image. 
                    I would say at level 3 to 4 for the hardness level.                    </p>

                <h4> 2) What's the difficulty?</h4>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">As a photographer myself, I found this lab is pretty straightforward and easy to work on. </p>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">However, those who don't usually edit picture or take photo, it could take them a while to 
                    process the materials and get to learn the new thing.     </p>

                <h4> 3) How did you solve it?</h4>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">As a new person perspective, start from the basic adjustment such as Exposure, where you can 
                    discover many options to enhance your quality picture.  </p>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">As a professional image editor, you can continue with details stuff like Sharpen, Smoothing, 
                    Glow, Focus area,....                                   </p>

                <h4> 4) Is it Fun?</h4>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">It was fun for me, as I haven't done these editing for while due to school work and work load outside.</p>

                <h4> 5) Anything that you want me to know?</h4>
                <p style="padding-right: 300px; text-indent: 50px;">Nothing specific, all the required information I have provided and it should be enough.</p>
