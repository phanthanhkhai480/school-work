				<p><b>Short Introduction of myself:</b> My name is Khai Phan Thanh, I am from BSD Program at Seneca (for those who don't know it is Honours Bachelor of Technology - Software Development). 
					Besides Education Learning Skills, I also learn about Hardware component, by myself, about its structural and impact on Software. As we all know and see, technology is becoming 
					part of out life. Everything we do requires technology, from the keyboard I use to type these line to the monitor that I can see what am I typing and you can see the content here. 
					Many of you will say how magical it is for technology to do such many things. </p>
	
				<p>Besides Technology, my other interest is Aviation. Since the date I come to Canada, I’ve discovered so many new things about myself, including get to understand myself a lot more 
					about what I interest to what am I passionate about. What I love about Aviation is that it is tightly connected with I.T field, from every pieces of Hardware to built up the plane 
					to Software that help the plane monitors its Hardware. </p>
					
				<p>In my living style, there is a quote that I love the most and that quote is the reason persuade me to keep working and studying harder to achieve the goal. “And, when you want something, 
					the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it” – <i>the Alchemist, Paulo Coelho</i>. But that just, a quote saying, I mean, you still need to work hard and get it, nothing would come for
					free without hard working. It’s just a reminder to myself that, all the inspire and hard work will be compensate to you some times in the future, so never give up and persuade what you love. </p>
